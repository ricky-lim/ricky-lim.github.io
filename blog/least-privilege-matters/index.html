  <p>Ever wondered why some installations require sudo while others don't? Or why Docker containers might create files owned by root?
This guide explains the principle of least privilege and shows practical examples for safer practices not only when using tools but also during development.</p>
<h3>sudo vs su: What's the Difference?</h3>
<p>In our daily work, we often depend on external tools, which frequently require the use of <code>sudo</code> or <code>su</code> to install.
Both are commonly used to elevate privileges ‚Äî but they operate differently with distinct security implications:</p>
<p><code>sudo</code> lets a user to run specific commands with elevated (root) privileges. It‚Äôs temporary ‚Äî typically only for about 5 minutes ‚Äî and is ideal for one-off commands like <code>sudo apt update</code>.
Watch out with <code>su</code>, because it switches your session to another user (usually root), giving you a full shell with root privileges that persist until you manually kill it. There‚Äôs no timeout.</p>
<p>For most installation tasks, <code>sudo</code> is your safer choice. It limits the duration and scope of elevated access, reducing your risk of accidental or unauthorized system changes.</p>
<p>However, before installing external tools with <code>sudo</code>, <strong>pause</strong> and ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>Is it really necessary? Could this be done with user-level permissions instead of root access?</strong></p>
<p>Often, there are safer alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Python, use a virtual environment <code>python -m venv .venv</code> instead of installing packages system-wide.</li>
<li>For Node.js, use <code>nvm</code> (Node Version Manager) to manage versions and install without sudo.</li>
<li>For Java, use <code>sdkman</code> to install and switch between versions in user space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Least Privilege for Tool Installation ?</h3>
<p><strong>The principal of least privilege</strong> means granting only the minimum permissions necessary to perform a task - and no more.</p>
<p>Imagine you're staying at a hotel. Every guest is given a key that opens only their own room - not every room in the hotel.
Then, the cleaning staffs may have different keys that can open a limited set of guest rooms.
Only the hotel owner has a master key that can open every door.</p>
<p>If our guest loses their key, then a potential thief can <strong>only</strong> enter a room and <strong>not</strong> the whole hotel.
But if everyone was given the master key, losing just one would set the entire hotel at risk.</p>
<p>In the same way, <strong>the principle of least privilege</strong> should inspire our interactions with tools by limiting access to what the tools need.
This reduces potential damage if something goes wrong.
In case our system is compromised, the attacker can not easily gain full control without further exploitation.</p>
<p>Therefore, wehenever possible, tools should be installed and run with the least permissions required.</p>
<h3>Privilege Levels Visualized</h3>
<p>To better understand this concept, it's helpful to visualize the different privilege levels typically used in a Unix-like environment:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">üîë Regular User
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Limited access to user&#39;s files

üîê sudo User
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Temporary elevated access

üëë Root User (su)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Complete system access
</code></pre>
<h3>Docker: Why User Privilege Matter ?</h3>
<p>Docker is one of the widely adopted tool among researchers and developers, especially in data science.
However, it's essential to understand that Docker has unique security implications.
Mainly because the Docker daemon runs as root by default.</p>
<p>When you run a docker container, it interacts directly with the docker daemon.
As a result, the container can execute commands with root-level priveleges on the host - <strong>even without typing <code>sudo</code> or <code>su</code></strong>.</p>
<p>This behavior can have serious security implications, especially if your workloads are later deployed on a bare Linux environment.
In such cases, actions carried as root inside containers can potentially harm your linux host.</p>
<p>For example, on a Linux system running the native Docker Engine (not Docker Desktop), you can easily create root-owned files on your host from inside a container:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-Dockerfile"># Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
</code></pre>
<p>Build the Image:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ docker build -t ubuntu:root .
</code></pre>
<p>Then run a container that creates a file in your current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ docker run --rm -v &quot;$(pwd):/app&quot; ubuntu:root touch /app/root.txt
$ ls -lh root.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 May 27 19:00 root.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, root.txt is owned by root on your host, which can cause permission issues and represents a security risk üò± .</p>
<h4>How to make it safer.</h4>
<p>To avoid these problems, you can explicitly create and use a non-root user inside your Docker container. Here‚Äôs an improved Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-Dockerfile">FROM ubuntu:22.04

ARG username=appuser
ARG UID=1000
ARG GID=1000

RUN groupadd -g ${GID} ${USERNAME} \
    &amp;&amp; useradd -m -u ${UID} -g ${GID} ${USERNAME}

USER ${USERNAME}
WORKDIR /home/${USERNAME}
</code></pre>
<p>Build the safer image, by explicitly set your host user's UID and GID:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ docker build -t ubuntu:safe -f Dockerfile-safe --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) .
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when you run the container and create a file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ docker run --rm -v &quot;$(pwd):/app&quot; ubuntu:safe touch /app/safe.txt
$ ls -lh safe.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">-rw-r--r-- 1 rlim rlim 0 May 27 19:05 safe.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The file is now owned by a regular user <code>rlim</code>, not root. This is safer and also easier to manage.</p>
<p>Note: Docker Desktop for MacOS uses a Linux VM and a special filesystem to map file ownership.
Therefore even if the container runs as root, files created in mounted directories are owned by a MacOS user.
That being said, it's still important to be mindful that containers can run as root by default, especially when deploying on bare Linux host.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid installing tools with <code>sudo</code>; always prefer user-level installations when possible.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the privilege level your containers run with, and choose to run them as non-root users to minimize security risks and permission issues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Be least in privilege but abundant in curiosity ‚Äî while your tools should never run as root, your mind should always be rooting new ideas!</p>
</blockquote>
