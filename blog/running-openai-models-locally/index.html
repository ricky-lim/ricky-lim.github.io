  <p>Running open AI models locally offers several advantages, particularly when it comes to <strong>data privacy</strong>.
Think about when you want to <strong>summarize</strong> or <strong>parse</strong> information from your sensitive documents like your bank statements or medical records.
Would you want to upload them to a third-party AI service? Probably <strong><em>not</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll share my experience running OpenAI models locally on my personal laptop using Ollama.</p>
<h2>What are OpenAI models?</h2>
<p>At their core, AI models are simply <strong>token generators</strong> that produce one token after another to produce text.
Here's a simplified look at how they work:</p>
<p><strong>1. Tokenization</strong></p>
<p>Your input is first brokend down into tokens. A single word may be split into multiple tokens.
Why tokens? Instead of human words that can be ambiguous with different languages, tokens are standardized units for the model to consume.</p>
<p>The tokenizer outputs a list of numerical <strong>token ids</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Passing tokens through the model</strong></p>
<p>These token IDs are consumed into the model, which consists of many interconnected layers like neurons.
Each connection has a weight that was learned during training.</p>
<p><strong>3. Generating the next token</strong></p>
<p>The model then generate candidate next tokens.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>"The most used programming language for data science is &lt;python: 80%&gt;, &lt;R: 15%&gt;, &lt;Javascript: 5%&gt;".</strong></p>
<p>The percentage is the probability of each token to be selected and this can be configured within the model parameters.</p>
<p>Final output:</p>
<p><strong>"The most used programming language for data science is python".</strong></p>
<h3>What does "Open" mean in "OpenAI models"?</h3>
<p>"open" in this context mainly refers to the <strong>model weights</strong> being open sourced, not the training code or the training data.
This means when you run the model locally, you're using these <strong>pre-trained</strong> weights.</p>
<p>The good news is that the performance of Open AI models have caught up significantly, making them practical for local use.</p>
<h2>Can we run on my machine?</h2>
<p>Thanks to quantization techniques, we can now run these models without requiring massive virtual memory.</p>
<p>In short, quantization converts model weights from floats to integers, which shrinks the model size dramatically (about 1/4 of the original).</p>
<p>To quickly estimate the lower-bound memory requirements for a model, I use this simple "back-of-the-envelope" rule:</p>
<pre><code>Memory (in GB) = (Model size in billions of parameters) x 3 GB
</code></pre>
<p>For example <code>gemma3:27b</code> has 27 billion parameters, so it requires roughly <code>27 x 3 = 81 GB</code>.
With quantization, that drops to about 1/4, which is around <code>20 GB</code>.</p>
<h2>How do I run it on my machine?</h2>
<p>My go-to tool is <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>, which works like Docker but for AI models.</p>
<p>You can install Ollama from their <a href="https://ollama.com/download">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Once installed, you can now run OpenAI models locally.</p>
<pre><code>$ ollama run gemma3:27b-it-qat
</code></pre>
<p>If you run it for the first time, it will pull the model from their registry and load it into memory to run.</p>
<p>Once run, you can interact with the model naturally.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; What can you do ?

I&#39;m Gemma, a large language model created by the Gemma team at Google DeepMind. I&#39;m an open-weights AI assistant, which means I&#39;m widely available to the public!

I take text *and* images as inputs and output text only. I&#39;m pretty good at:

*   **Generating creative text formats:** Poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I&#39;ll try my best to follow your requirements.
*   **Answering your questions in a comprehensive and informative way.** I can draw upon a vast knowledge base, though my knowledge is limited to what I was trained on and I don&#39;t have access to real-time information.
*   **Following your instructions and completing your requests thoughtfully.**

I&#39;m still under development, but I&#39;m learning new things every day.

**Important things to note:**

*   I don&#39;t have access to tools, real-time information or Google search.
*   I can receive images as input but will only output text.
*   I am an open weights model, widely available to the public.
*   I was trained by Google DeepMind.


What can I help you with today?
</code></pre>
<p>You can also interact with the ollama command directly. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; /show info
  Model
    architecture        gemma3
    parameters          27.4B
    context length      131072
    embedding length    5376
    quantization        Q4_0

  Capabilities
    completion
    vision

  Parameters
    temperature    1
    top_k          64
    top_p          0.95
    stop           &quot;&lt;end_of_turn&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the model information that we can tweak.</p>
<p>The first information that is important is the <code>context length</code>, think about it like the memory of the model.
The longer the context length, the more information the model will remember.
Watch out ! The <code>context_length</code> shown here is actually the <strong>maximum</strong> context length <strong>not</strong> the one that the model is currently using ⚠️.</p>
<p>Let's configure the context length to 10_000 tokens.
Keep in mind that the larger context length will also consume more memory!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; /set num_ctx 10000
Set parameter &#39;num_ctx&#39; to &#39;10000&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Another parameter that I like to tweak is the <code>temperature</code>, controlling the randomness of the output or the creativity of the model.
A lower temperature means the model will be more deterministic, while the higher value means the model will be more creative.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># Example to make it more deterministic
&gt;&gt;&gt; /set temperature 0.3
</code></pre>
<p>To provide a base instruction to the model, we can also add the system prompt. It's like setting the behavior for the model.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; /set system &quot;&quot;&quot;
You&#39;re a helpful and critical assistant.
Your answer should be concise.&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can also provide our input message.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi I&#39;m Ricky Lim
Greetings, Ricky Lim. It&#39;s efficient that you&#39;ve introduced yourself. How may I be of assistance today? Be specific; brevity is appreciated.
</code></pre>
<p>To also save our model session, we can <code>/save &lt;session_name&gt;</code> and load it later with <code>/load &lt;session_name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; /save ricky-session
Created new model &#39;ricky-session&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; /bye
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can resume the session later:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">$ ollama run gemma3:27b-it-qat
&gt;&gt;&gt; /load ricky-session
&gt;&gt;&gt; what is my name?
Your name is Ricky Lim. A rather straightforward question, and one easily answered given your prior statement.
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! now my model session can remember my name.</p>
<h2>How can I create my customized model?</h2>
<p>Customization of the model via ollama terminal can be done by setting the parameters interactively, but can we automate it?</p>
<p>Yes, we can! Like <code>Dockerfile</code>, we can create a <code>Modelfile</code> to provide the blueprint of our customized model.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the <code>Modelfile</code> of our previous session:</p>
<pre><code>FROM gemma3:27b-it-qat

PARAMETER num_ctx 10000
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

SYSTEM """
You're a helpful and critical assistant.
Your answer should be concise.
"""

MESSAGE user Hi I'm Ricky Lim
</code></pre>
<p>You can then build the model using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">$ ollama create rlim-agent -f Modelfile
gathering model components
....

# To list the created model
$ ollama list
NAME                    ID              SIZE     MODIFIED
rlim-agent:latest       49858041cab9    18 GB    6 seconds ago
ricky-session:latest    1b3bb0f1fea8    18 GB    6 minutes ago
gemma3:27b-it-qat       29eb0b9aeda3    18 GB    25 hours ago
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see now I have three models, the base model <code>gemma3:27b-it-qat</code>, my saved session <code>ricky-session</code> and my customized model <code>rlim-agent</code>.
It looks like I have three models consuming about 54 GB of disk space.
Luckily, <strong>this is not the case</strong> as Ollama uses a layered file system like Docker, so it saves only the delta between the derivative models and the base model.
In other words, it's not really consuming 54 GB, but only about 18 GB + small deltas for the other two derivative models.</p>
<p>Now we can run our customized model directly:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">$ ollama run rlim-agent
&gt;&gt;&gt; what is my name?
Your name is Ricky Lim.
</code></pre>
<p>Ollama also provides a nice way to monitor the running models:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">$ ollama ps
NAME                 ID              SIZE     PROCESSOR    CONTEXT    UNTIL
rlim-agent:latest    49858041cab9    23 GB    100% GPU     10000      4 minutes from now
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see that the model is consuming about 23 GB of memory with 10,000 context length.
Also the <code>UNTIL</code> column shows when the model will be unloaded from memory due to inactivity.
Default is 5 minutes, but we can change it. When running the model using the <code>--keepalive</code> flag.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># Keep it alive for 60 minutes
$ ollama run rlim-agent --keepalive 60m
$ ollama ps
NAME                 ID              SIZE     PROCESSOR    CONTEXT    UNTIL
rlim-agent:latest    49858041cab9    23 GB    100% GPU     10000      59 minutes from now
</code></pre>
<h2>Use case: Image description</h2>
<p>Since our customized model also supports computer vision, we can use it to describe images locally without uploading them to third-party services.
For this, I created a simple <a href="describe_image.py">python script</a> that uses the <code>ollama</code> python package to interact with the model.</p>
<p>Here is the script looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">model_name = &quot;rlim-agent&quot;

prompt = &quot;&quot;&quot;
You are an AI model that describes images in JSON format.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

json_schema = {
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
    &quot;properties&quot;: {
        &quot;who&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Description of the person(s) in the image.&quot;,
        },
        &quot;where&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,
            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Description of the location or setting of the image.&quot;,
        },
    },
    &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;who&quot;, &quot;where&quot;],
}


def describe(image_path):
    response = ollama.chat(
        model=model_name,
        messages=[
            {
                &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
                &quot;content&quot;: prompt,
                &quot;images&quot;: [image_path],
            }
        ],
        format=json_schema,
        stream=False,
    )
    return response[&quot;message&quot;][&quot;content&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The script is quite straightforward. We provide the model with three key pieces of information:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The system prompt</strong> for the model instructions</p>
<p>2. <strong>The JSON schema</strong> so we can have a structured output</p>
<p>3. <strong>The image path</strong> for the model to describe</p>
<p>You can run the script like this:</p>
<p>For example with a <code>me.png</code> image:</p>
<p><img src="me-small.png" alt=""></p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># Before run ensure that the ollama server is running.
$ uv run describe_image.py me.png
{
  &quot;who&quot;: &quot;Ricky Lim&quot;,
  &quot;where&quot;: &quot;Emirates Stadium, London, UK&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Voila 🥳! my customized model can describe my image at the home of Arsenal FC!</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to quantization, we can now run Open AI models locally on our machines, keeping our data private.</li>
<li>Ollama makes it easy to run and customize OpenAI models locally.</li>
<li>Define your model customization using a <code>Modelfile</code>, like with <code>Dockerfile</code>.</li>
</ul>
