Have you ever needed to say **"never"**?
Sometimes, when coding, explicitly indicating something should **never** happen can actually save you.

Imagine you're developing data processing pipeline for laboratory automation.
Each step in the pipeline - ***sample preparation, dilution, mixing*** - is an **enum** value in your logic.
What happens if new steps are added, e.g ***normalization***, but you forget to update your critical code that handles each step 😶‍🌫️?
Your processing pipeline can silently skip 🤐 or worse produce errors in production 🔥.
Missing a single processing step, could mean making flawed results based on incomplete processing pipeline 🙅.

🛃 Exhaustive checks over enums, ensures your code aware to such future changes by providing warning about unhandled cases.
That's where Python's special type `Never` comes to the rescue.

## Never

It's introduced in Python 3.11 in `typing` module and is used to represent a value that should **never** be returned.
It's mostly found in code to annotate functions that always raise exceptions or terminate the program.

For example:

```Python
import sys
from typing import Never


def lab_processing_error(message: str) -> Never:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Lab processing error: {message}")
```

Here, `lab_processing_error` will **never** return and triggers runtime error and stops execution.

Besides signaling errors, the `Never` type can also be useful for making sure all possible cases (like enum values) are handled in your code.

## Using `Never` for Exhaustive Enums

In a data science project, you can use an `Enum` to represent a finite set of experiment steps. Let's say:

```Python
class LabStep(Enum):
    SAMPLE_PREPARATION = auto()
    DILUTION = auto()
    MIXING = auto()
```

And in your main logic, you want to ensure that all steps are being processed.
The power of `Never` shines in the default of your processing logic.
When you annotate this default branch using `Never` it's telling the type checker that this is the "impossible case" so it should not happen.
If it does happen, it means that you have future enum values that are not yet handled.

### Example

```Python
def liquid_handler(step: LabStep) -> str:
    match step:
        case LabStep.SAMPLE_PREPARATION:
            return "Prepare the sample..."
        case LabStep.DILUTION:
            return "Dilute the sample..."
        case LabStep.MIXING:
            return "Mix the sample..."
        case _:
            # This should never happen if all enums are handled
            _: Never = step
            raise RuntimeError(f"The step is unhandled: {step}")
```

When you add a new step, such as **normalization**.

```Python
class LabStep(Enum):
    SAMPLE_PREPARATION = auto()
    DILUTION = auto()
    MIXING = auto()
    NORMALIZATION = auto()  # New step added

def liquid_handler(step: LabStep) -> str:
    match step:
        case LabStep.SAMPLE_PREPARATION:
            return "Prepare the sample..."
        case LabStep.DILUTION:
            return "Dilute the sample..."
        case LabStep.MIXING:
            return "Mix the sample..."
        case _:
            _: Never = step
            raise RuntimeError(f"The step is unhandled: {step}")
```

The default case will now be reachable, unfortunately and when you run `mypy`, it will raise a type ***ERROR***, with a beautiful message.

The message is very clear, pointing you to the unhandled enum value 🙌 !

```bash
never_say_never.py:26: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Literal[LabStep.NORMALIZATION]", variable has type "Never")  [assignment]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

When you have the `mypy` extension enabled in VSCode, you’ll notice a helpful little red squiggle 〰️ like this:

![unhandled_enum_vscode](./unhandled_enum_error.png)

This error helps you as a reminder that you did NOT yet handle all your enum cases.

To fix this, we need to handle our new lab step.

```Python
def liquid_handler(step: LabStep) -> str:
    match step:
        case LabStep.SAMPLE_PREPARATION:
            return "Prepare the sample..."
        case LabStep.DILUTION:
            return "Dilute the sample..."
        case LabStep.MIXING:
            return "Mix the sample..."
        # Handle the missing step
        case LabStep.NORMALIZATION:
            return "Normalize the sample..."
        case _:
            _: Never = step
            raise RuntimeError(f"The step is unhandled: {step}")
```

Now the red squiggle is gone and also when you run again `mypy`, it happily reports 🥳:

```bash
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Exhaustive Enum**: Exhaustive enum handling is essential in data science as missing a case can lead to silent incorrect analysis
- **Never**: Python's `Never` type is your friend to provide a kind reminder for unhandled enum cases

When enums code split across files, team collaboration, and ever changing requirements as we make progress in science,
this pattern is our line of defense to catch errors before we run our code in production.

🫰 Consider giving `Never` a try in your projects. Enabling the `mypy` extension in VSCode and adding `mypy` checks to your CI pipeline can help us shipping more reliable code.
