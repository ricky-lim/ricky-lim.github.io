## Why Scientists Should Care About Makefiles 📚

In computational scientific research, automating repetitive tasks is essential.
By leveraging automation, Scientists can focus more on the science.

> Enter Makefile 📝—a simple yet powerful tool to automate your project development process.

Here's **when and when not** to use Makefiles:

### When to use Makefiles 📝

- Simplifying Repetitive Tasks:
Makefiles are ideal for automating routine tasks such as building code projects,
running tests, generating documentation and deploying applications.

- Efficiency and Reproducibility:
By defining dependencies and commands in a Makefile, researchers can automate tasks efficiently, saving time and reducing manual errors.
This also ensures that development process is reproducible across different environments, like on MacOs, Linux, or even Windows.

- Small to Medium-Sized Projects:
Makefiles are well-suited for smaller projects where dependencies are straightforward.
Keep it simple and avoid overcomplicating the Makefile.

### When not to use Makefiles 🚫

- Complex Projects:
For such complex data analysis pipelines with intricate dependencies or dynamic outputs, tools like Nextflow or Snakemake are more suitable.

- Large-Scale Projects:
As projects grow in size and complexity, Makefiles can become cumbersome.
They may struggle to scale efficiently with the computational resources required to run them, especially when managing large-scale data processing pipelines.

In summary, Makefiles are best for automating simple development tasks, while for complex data analysis tasks, consider more advanced tools.

## Getting Started with Makefiles 🚀

When you think Makefiles is the right fit for your project, let's dive in and explore how to set them up!


First get `Make` installed on your system.

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install make

# macOS
brew install make

# Windows
choco install make
```

⚠️ Please ensure proper tab indentation for the Makefile since Make requires **tabs**, not spaces for indentation.

🚨 Using spaces instead of tabs can lead to errors when running the Makefile, so configure your editor to use tabs for indentation.

Here's a basic [template](./Makefile) to get you started:

```makefile
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help

.PHONY: deploy
deploy: test docs build ## Deploy to production
	@echo "Deploying to production..."
	# Add your deployment commands here

.PHONY: test
test: ## Run tests
	@echo "Running tests..."
	# Add your test commands here

.PHONY: docs
docs: ## Generate documentation
	@echo "Generating documentation...."
	# Add your documentation commands here

.PHONY: build
build: ## Build the project
	@echo "Building the project..."
	# Add your build commands here

.PHONY: help
help:
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-16s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

```

#### How It Works

- Default Goal: The `help` target is set as the default. This means running `make` without any arguments will run the `help` target.

```bash
$ make
build            Build the project
deploy           Deploy to production
docs             Generate documentation
test             Run tests
```

- Phony Targets: Targets like `test` are action commands, not files.
These targets do not depend on whether files have been changed, they simply execute the commands.
- Help Message: The `help` target generates a help message with descriptions of each target.
- The dependencies are specified from Left to Right.
When you run `make deploy`, it will run these targets in sequence:
first `test`, then `docs`, followed by  `build`, and finally it will execute the `deploy` command.

### Key Takeaways

Makefiles are an underrated gem in the scientific world, offering powerful automation capabilities that take care of the boring tasks 🤖,
while ensuring efficiency and reproducibility of your development process.

By automating the boring, Makefiles let you focus on what matters most—the science itself 🔬.
