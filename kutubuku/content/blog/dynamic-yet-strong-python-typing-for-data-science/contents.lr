Have you ever spent hours debugging a data pipeline only to discover you accidentally passed a DataFrame where a Series was expected?
Or wondered why your colleague's function sometimes returns a list and sometimes a numpy array?
Python's type system can help prevent these headaches while keeping the flexibility that makes Python awesome for data science.

Python dominates data science for good reason.
Beyond its rich ecosystem, expressiveness and easy to use, Python has a unique type system that is ***dynamic*** and yet **strong**.

We can think of a type system as a label on a data container.
It tells us what kind of data is inside so we can get the idea of what operations we can perform.
Just like a package labeled "Fragile" tells us that it should be handled with care, a data type label like `int` or `str` informs us which operations are allowed.

### Python is strongly typed

What does it mean? Python enforces **no implicit type coercion** to perform data operations.

For example:

```python
temp = 26.5
temp + "c"  # ❌ TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'
```

In contrast, weakly typed languages such as JavaScript, will coerce one type to another which might lead to subtle bugs.

```JavaScript
temp = 26.5
temp + "c" # '26.5c'
```

In data science, we're working with different data types - strings, integers, floats, pandas.Series, etc.
Strong typing helps prevent subtle bugs by refusing to mix incompatible types unless it's done explicitly.

### Python is Also Dynamically Typed

Dynamically typed means that types are ***checked*** at **runtime**, when operations on objects are attempted.
With Dynamic typing property, Python supports Duck typing.
In practice, it means it doesn't matter what type an object is, only what an object can do.

It comes from the saying:

> If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck — it’s probably a duck.

If I can invoke `person.quack()`, then `person` is probably a duck in this context.

Duck typing offers flexibility and makes Python objects focus on "getting things done".

Dynamic typing makes Python easier to get started ***but*** allows **unsupported** operations that may cause errors at runtime 😱.

As a comparison to the dynamic typing is a static typing adopted by C, Java, go, and other compiled languages, where you must declare types ahead of time.
The types are then enforced at compile time - the compiler checks that types match before the program even built or runs.
This is more robust than duck typing, with the advantage of catching bugs early in the development process.

While there are benefits to static typing, there is also a price to pay.
The type system makes the language less expressive and harder to read.

For example, consider how you might annotate the type of HTTP headers in Python:

```python
# 😵‍💫 This is difficult to read
Headers = Union[
    Mapping[basestring, basestring],
    Iterable[Tuple[basestring, basestring]]
]
```

While many types are simple like `int`, `str`, or `list[float]` — others are more complex, especially with dynamic patterns like `**kwargs`.

Take Django settings, for example: config(**settings). The settings dictionary typically contains string keys, but its values can be strings, booleans, tuples, lists, or nested structures - only the universe knows.
Typing this precisely is tricky, even then the maintenance can be error-prone.

In Python typing is not a must but rather a hint to help your IDE, such as vscode helps you with autocompletion and error detection.
With external tools like `mypy`, you can also integrate type checking into your CI pipeline to catch type-related errors early.

That’s why it’s such a joy that with Python, you can choose to add type hints when you think it makes sense.
This flexibility gives you the benefits of type safety when needed, without sacrificing its expressiveness.

### Practical Typing Tips

When using type hints in data science, keeping a few key principles in mind can help you write clearer, more robust code.

1\. General vs Specific Types

In type system, the more general the type is like `object` the fewer operations it supports.
For example, `object` does not support  `__mul__` for multiplication, whereas more specific type like `int` does.

So, the more specific the type, the more functionality you get.
When you want to clearly define what operations are allowed, it's best to use more specific types.

2\. When annotating your functions: Be open to the input, and be specific about the output.

Following Postel's Law:

> Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send,

A good rule of thumb when annotating functions is:

- Use abstract collection types (like `Sequence`, `Mapping`, or `Iterable`) for input arguments to allow flexibility.
- Use concrete types (like `int`, `string`) for return values to make it clear exactly what the function outputs.

For example:

```
from typing import Sequence

def capitalize_names(names: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    return [name.capitalize() for name in names]
```

Input: `Sequence[str]`

- Sequence[str] accepts both lists and tuples, making the function more flexible for the caller.

Output: `list[str]`

- Returning list[str] makes it clear that the function produces a new list of strings, with no ambiguity.

### Practical Type Hints for Data Science

Here are some type hints that are especially useful in data science projects.

#### Optional

`Optional` is used when we want to use `None` as a default.

```python
from typing import Optional

def hello(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    return f"hello {name}" if name else "hello world"
```

### Union

We use `Union` to allow multiple types as options, and requires at least two types.

```python
from typing import Union

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f: Union[float, str]) -> float:
    ...

```

🙅 Also **avoid** using `Union` for redundant types.

```

# ❌ This is redundant because float also covers operations performed by int
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f: Union[int, float]) -> float:

# ✅ float will also accept int values
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f: float) -> float:
```

### Iterable

Iterable type is used to annotate anything you can loop over.
Example: `tuple`, `list`, `str`, `dict`.

Here is a practical example when we use `tuple` as type hints to represent a lab equipment (e.g from a database)

```python
# +------------+--------------+
# |equipment_id|equipment_name|
# +------------+--------------+
# |           1|    Microscope|
EquipmentRecord = tuple[int, str]

def get_equipment() -> tuple[EquipmentRecord]:
    ...
```

### Callable

Used to annotate function or callback parameters in higher-order functions.
Higher-order function is a function that takes another function as input or returns a function as output.
The signature of callable type:

```
Callable[[ParamType1, ParamType2], ReturnType]

# For no argument
Callable[[], ReturnType]

# With flexible signature
Callable[..., ReturnType]
```

For example:

```
from typing import Callable

def convert_temp(n: float, convert_fn: Callable[[float], float]) -> float:
    return convert_fn(n)

# Usage example
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f: float) -> float:
    return (f - 32) * 5 / 9

def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c: float) -> float:
    return c * 9 / 5 + 32

print(convert_temp(212, fahrenheit_to_celsius))
print(convert_temp(100, celsius_to_fahrenheit))
```

## Key take aways

- **Python is strongly typed**: No implicit type coercion prevents subtle bugs when mixing incompatible types
- **Dynamic typing enables duck typing**: Focus on what objects can do rather than what they are
- **Start small**: Gradually add types when it makes sense
- **Follow Postel's Law**: When annotating functions, be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send. Your users will thank you.

Remember: type hints are your helpful assistant, not your strict police!
