Testing Dockerized Python Applications with Docker ‚ù§Ô∏è Testcontainers ‚ù§Ô∏è Pytest.

## Why ?

When developing a dockerized Python application that needs a database, testing can be challenging.
We often need to set up and manage test databases, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. 

In this blog post, I am going to take you through a practical example of how to use Docker + Testcontainers + Pytest, to simplify the testing process.

### üê≥ Docker + üß™ Testcontainers + üéØ Pytest

This powerful testing stack leverages three powerful Python tools:

- **D**ocker SDK for Python (docker) - Lets us programmatically control Docker, build images, and run containers right from our Python code
- **T**estcontainers - A library that creates on-demand, isolated Docker containers for your tests.
- **P**ytest - A robust testing framework that makes writing and running tests ***fun*** again, with fixtures that automagically handle setup and teardown

Together, they create a seamless automation where:

- Docker SDK builds and manages our application container
- Testcontainers handles our PostgreSQL test database
- Pytest orchestrates everything with elegant fixtures

Note: Throughout this blog, we'll refer to this testing trinity as the **DTP** stack.


## Analogy

Testing with **DTP** stack is like modern laboratory automation:

- Manual testing = A scientist performing each step: prepare, experiment, and clean up every time 
- Docker + Testcontainers + Pytest = A laboratory robot that self-prepares, self-executes, and self-destructs after each experiment

Let's walk through a practical example from a demo repository: https://github.com/ricky-lim/pycontainer-demo

Our demo repository features a simple dockerized python application, `robot`, that works with a database.

Get ready to see how we can test this application from manual testing to automated testing with DTP stack.

### üêò Manual Testing
In the manual testing approach, the process looks like this:

- Set up a test database (also ensure it's ready to use)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
$ docker run -d --name robot-postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:17-alpine

# Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
$ until docker exec robot-postgres pg_isready -U postgres; do echo "Waiting for PostgreSQL..."; sleep 1; done
```

- Build and run the application

```bash
# Build the docker application
$ docker build -t robot .

# Run the docker application
$ docker run -it --network host robot add --name pixie --description "cleaning up my garden"
```

- Run the test

```bash
# Check if the robot was added
$ docker exec -it robot-postgres psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT * FROM robot;"

 id | name  |      description
----+-------+-----------------------
  1 | pixie | cleaning up my garden
(1 row)
```

- Clean up the database

```bash
# Stop and remove the PostgreSQL container
$ docker stop robot-postgres
$ docker rm robot-postgres

# Clean your docker application
$ docker rmi robot
```

Manual testing works, but we can do better!

Just as laboratory automation revolutionized scientific research,
our **DTP** stack can supercharge our testing process into a streamlined operation.

### Automated Testing with DTP

Let's discover how Ô∏èDTP, turns our boring manual tasks into an elegant automated solution.

First, we automate the setup of our test in `conftest.py`.
Here are the key features that power our DTP stack.

The complete code is available in the [conftest.py](https://github.com/ricky-lim/pycontainer-demo/blob/main/tests/robot/conftest.py).

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def robot_docker_image(docker_client, request):
    dockerfile = request.config.rootpath / "Dockerfile"
    image, _ = docker_client.images.build(
        path=str(dockerfile.parent),
        dockerfile=dockerfile.name,
        tag="robot:test",
    )

    request.addfinalizer(lambda: docker_client.images.remove(image.id, force=True))
    return image


@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def docker_robot(postgres_container, robot_docker_image, docker_client):
    def _run_robot_command(command: list[str]):
        return docker_client.containers.run(
            robot_docker_image.id,
            command=command,
            tty=True,
            stderr=True,
            stdout=True,
            extra_hosts={DOCKER_HOST: "host-gateway"},
            environment={
                "PGUSER": postgres_container.username,
                "PGPASSWORD": postgres_container.password,
                "PGHOST": DOCKER_HOST,
                "PGPORT": postgres_container.get_exposed_port(5432),
                "PGDATABASE": postgres_container.dbname,
            },
        )

    return _run_robot_command


@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def postgres_container():
    with PostgresContainer(POSTGRES_IMAGE) as postgres:
        yield postgres


@pytest.fixture
def robot_repository(postgres_container):
    repo = RobotRepository(postgres_container.get_connection_url())
    repo.init_db()
    return repo
```

Key Features:

- `robot_docker_image`: This fixture is to dockerize our robot application.
- `docker_robot`: This fixture is to run the dockerized robot application.
- `postgres_container`: This fixture is to set up a PostgreSQL container.
- `robot_repository`: This fixture is to set up a robot database repository.

üéØ Here's how we leverage the DTP stack in our tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.end_to_end
def test_robot_add_and_get(docker_robot):
    # Create robot
    result = docker_robot(
        [
            "add",
            "--name",
            "pixie",
            "--description",
            "cleaning up my garden",
        ]
    )
    assert "Robot created successfully" in result.decode()

    # Verify using both name and id lookups
    for get_cmd in [
        ["get", "--name", "pixie"],
        ["get", "--id", "1"],
    ]:
        result = docker_robot(get_cmd)
        output = result.decode()
        assert "pixie" in output
        assert "cleaning up my garden" in output
```

The DTP stack transforms our test into a clean, expressive implementation that runs with a simple command:

```bash
pytest -m end_to_end
```

With this approach, we can scale our testing process and for the complete example, please refer to [test_docker_cli.py](https://github.com/ricky-lim/pycontainer-demo/blob/main/tests/robot/test_docker_cli.py).

## CI/CD

As a bonus, we can also integrate this part of CI/CD pipeline to automate this process.

Check out our Github Actions workflow that demonstrates this powerful automation on [ci.yml](https://github.com/ricky-lim/pycontainer-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

The same elegant testing process will run automatically on every pull request, ensuring consistent quality during development.

This is modern DevOps at its finest! üöÄ
