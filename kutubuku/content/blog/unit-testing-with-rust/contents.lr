Coming from a ***non-software*** background, testing was not something I learned from school.
When I started my journey in data science, testing honestly was not something I paid much attention to.
However, as I progressed in my career, I realized that I started running into the same kinds of issues over and over again.
A small data change would break my code, and a small change that looks harmless would make my data pipeline fail 💔.
This experience made me realize the importance of testing, and started to learn more about it 💡.

I’m definitely ***not*** an expert in testing, and when I first started learning, it was both exciting and also kind of overwhelming.
Here, I’d like to share a concept that really helped me navigate the complexity of testing.
And since I’m currently a bit obsessed by Rust, I’ll also include a simple example in Rust as well.

## Testing Pyramid

The concept that helped me navigate is the **testing pyramid**.
It helps me to break down the complexity of testing, and also start simple.

In the testing pyramid, we have three main types of tests: **end-to-end tests**, **integration tests**, and **unit tests**.
This concept simplifies the complexity of testing as we look into the cost and speed of running the tests.

```
 cost ↑                ┌───────────────┐
      │                │ End-to-End    │  ← Highest cost, slowest
      │                └───────────────┘
      │             ┌─────────────────────┐
      │             │ Integration Tests   │
      │             └─────────────────────┘
      │         ┌─────────────────────────────┐
      │         │      Unit Tests             │  ← Lowest cost, fastest
      │         └─────────────────────────────┘
      └─────────────────────────────────────────────→ speed ↑
```

At the top of the pyramid, we have **end-to-end tests**.
These tests cover the way we expect our users to use our application.
These tests come at the highest cost, and also the slowest to run as we need to have our system like frontend, backend, and database up and running 🔛.
However, these tests provide the highest level of confidence that our system works as expected and are less likely to change throughout development.

In the middle of the pyramid, we have **integration tests**.
These tests focus on a particular part of our application, for example, a particular backend service.

At the bottom of the pyramid, we have **unit tests**, which is the **foundation**.
These tests focus on the lowest unit of our application, like, a particular `function`.
As being foundation of the pyramid, these tests are the ***most essential***, ensuring our business logic is correct.

Let's look into each type of tests from a ticketing application example.
Here is the high-level diagram of our application.

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    User     │
        └─────┬───────┘
              │
              ▼
        ┌─────────────┐
        │  Frontend   │
        └─────┬───────┘
              │
   ┌──────────┴───────────┐
   │          │           │
   ▼          ▼           ▼
┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│Backend │ │Backend │ │Backend │
│  A     │ │  B     │ │  C     │
└───┬────┘ └───┬────┘ └───┬────┘
    │          │          │
    ▼          ▼          ▼
┌───────┐  ┌───────┐  ┌────────────┐
│Database│ │Database│ │Other System│
└───────┘  └───────┘  └────────────┘
```

## End-to-end tests
An example of an end-to-end test is testing a complete user journey.
One such journey is creating a ticket.

In this flow, the user first authenticates, then creates a ticket through the frontend.
The frontend calls Backend A to create the ticket, and Backend A stores it in the database.
During the ticket creation process, we also calls Backend B to fetch additional information.
Meanwhile, during authentication, Backend C is called to handle user authentication and authorization.

## Integration tests

In the integration tests, we put our focus on a particular part of the system.
In this case, we divide the system into three parts.

```
Integration Test A      Integration Test B      Integration Test C
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│  Frontend   │         │  Frontend   │         │  Frontend   │
└─────┬───────┘         └─────┬───────┘         └─────┬───────┘
      │                       │                       │
      ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌──────────┐            ┌──────────┐             ┌──────────┐
│Backend A │            │Backend B │             │Backend C │
└─────┬────┘            └─────┬────┘             └─────┬────┘
      │                       │                        │
      ▼                       ▼                        ▼
┌──────────┐            ┌──────────┐             ┌──────────┐
│Database A│            │Database B│             │Database C│
└──────────┘            └──────────┘             └──────────┘
```

Integration Test A focuses on the create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations of tickets.
Integration Test B focuses on the integration with application B via REST API.
Integration Test C focuses on the integration with authentication / authorization system.

## Unit tests

In unit tests, we zoom in further, for example on Backend A.
This backend adopts the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, as shown below.

```
┌─────────────┐
│ Controller  │  (Backend A)
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Model     │
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Repository  │
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Database A  │
└─────────────┘
```

Here we can have unit tests for each component of the MVC pattern.
Example here is the model for our ticketing application.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Card {
    summary: Option<String>,
    card_type: Type,
    status: Status,
    reporter: Option<String>,
    assignee: Option<String>,
    description: Option<String>,
    id: Option<u32>,
}

impl Default for Card {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Card {
            summary: None,
            card_type: Type::default(),
            status: Status::default(),
            reporter: None,
            assignee: None,
            description: None,
            id: None,
        }
    }
}

impl PartialEq for Card {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.summary == other.summary
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
enum Status {
    TODO,
    INPROGRESS,
    DONE,
    CANCELLED,
}

impl Default for Status {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Status::TODO
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
enum Type {
    STORY,
    TASK,
    BUG,
}

impl Default for Type {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Type::TASK
    }
}
```

Here, we’re working with a Card struct — basically a model that represents a ticket.
It also has a bit of business logic for comparing one card with another.

Here, we implement `PartialEq` trait to compare two cards and say they are equal if their summaries are the same.
For our enums, we use macros derive `PartialEq` to simplify the comparison logic.
Our unit tests will focus on this piece: the Card struct itself and how that comparison logic works.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_defaults() {
        let c = Card::default();
        assert_eq!(c.summary, None);
        assert_eq!(c.card_type, Type::TASK);
        assert_eq!(c.status, Status::TODO);
        assert_eq!(c.reporter, None);
        assert_eq!(c.assignee, None);
        assert_eq!(c.description, None);
        assert_eq!(c.id, None);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_equality() {
        let c1 = Card {
            summary: Some("something".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        let c2 = Card {
            summary: Some("something".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        assert_eq!(c1, c2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_equality_with_diff_ids() {
        let c1 = Card {
            id: Some(123),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        let c2 = Card {
            id: Some(456),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        assert_eq!(c1, c2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_inequality() {
        let c1 = Card {
            summary: Some("something 1".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        let c2 = Card {
            summary: Some("something 2".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        assert_ne!(c1, c2);
    }
}
```
For unit-tests, Rust comes with these basic asserting macros:
- `assert!` to assert a boolean expression is true, `assert!(boolean, "optional message")`
- `assert_eq!` to assert two values are equal, `assert_eq!(left, right, "optional message")`
- `assert_ne!` to assert two values are not equal, `assert_ne!(left, right, "optional message")`

Here we have four unit tests.
1. `test_defaults` to test the default values of the `Card` struct.
2. `test_equality` to test two cards with the same summary are equal.
3. `test_equality_with_diff_ids` to test two cards with different IDs but same summary are equal.
4. `test_inequality` to test two cards with different summaries are not equal.

In Rust, the convention is to put unit tests in the same file as the code itself.
I think this is a good practice, as it makes it easy to find the tests related to the code and also serves as documentation for the code itself.

We can group the tests as a test module by annotating with `#[cfg(test)]`.
The nice thing about this annotation is that the test module is only compiled when we run `cargo test`, and excluded in `cargo build`.
As such our test codes are ***not*** shipped to production - which is neat.


## Key takeaways

- Focus on unit tests where is cheap and fast to run while enforcing the business logic is correct.
- Unit tests are also the better documentation for our code than `README.md` because it's synced and executable.
- In Rust, we put unit tests in the same file as the code itself.
