In the world of data science, data can accumulate suddenly üìà and consume most of our available storage ü™´, which often goes ***unnoticed*** ü§ê.
This can be the root of annoying issues ü§ï.
In the worst case, when my disk completely filled up, I couldn‚Äôt even reach my remote machine anymore üò≠.

The other day, I run into this same issue when my disk bloated ü´É to nearly 90%.
So it was time to roll up my sleeves to start my digital clean-up journey üßπ.
To make my journey fun and also more efficient üöÄ, I began looking for a terminal tool to assist ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when I came across `ncdu` üí°.

## What is `ncdu`?

`ncdu` is short for NCurses Disk Usage, or to me it's a TUI for our traditional `du`.
With `ncdu`, we can scan and interactively navigate our directories to hunt for disk hogs and remove them.

> Terminal users can also have a nice TUI too when it comes to cleaning up.

### Getting started

```sh
sudo apt install ncdu  # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install ncdu      # macOS
```

Run it directly with `ncdu` and it's very much intuitive to use.
The TUI interface shows disk usage with sortable lists from the most bloated directory.
Use arrow keys and `enter` to drill down.
To delete the bloated files simply press `d` key.

To avoid future issue with running out of disk space, I also added my terminal prompt with disk usage,  ‚öìÔ∏èÔ∏è docked at the right side of my terminal.

A simple way to add disk usage information:

```sh
# Inside my .zshrc file
disk_usage() {
  # Replace with the path ('/') you want to check
  df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'
}

# This is to dock at the right side
RPROMPT='Disk: $(disk_usage)%'
```

# Key Takeaways

In the world of data science, disk space can be as valuable as compute power:

- Use **`ncdu`** to manage storage interactively and prevent annoying disk-related disruptions.
- Keep disk usage in check by displaying it directly in your **terminal prompt**.
