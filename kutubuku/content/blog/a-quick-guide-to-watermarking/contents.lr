In many situations - whether it's for personal (e.g travel documents) or professional setting (e.g business contracts) - we're dealing with sensitive documents.
We want to ensure that these documents are marked as CONFIDENTIAL.
Adding a watermark is a simple way to make this explicit.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it using Python with the watermark library:

- **Single File Example**: Add a grid watermark to a report called report.pdf:

```bash
$ uvx watermark grid report.pdf "CONFIDENTIAL" -h 3 -v 3 -s watermarked_report.pdf
```

- **Batch Processing**: Apply the same grid watermark to all PDFs in a folder:

```bash
$ uvx watermark grid report_folder "CONFIDENTIAL" -h 3 -v 3 -s watermarked_folder
```

This approach is quick, and works for both individual files and batches.

## Key Takeaways

Using `watermark` is an easy yet powerful way to mark your documents as confidential.
Give it a try and watermark your documents effortlessly!
