After building [TimerTui](https://github.com/ricky-lim/timertui), I've got the basics of how to build a TUI.
So, I rolled up my sleeves to experiment something fun.
That led me to create a simple retro game "Invader".

This is what the gameplay looks like:

</div>

# Why Textual

Textual as a framework provides terminal hacks that make creating a retro game surprisingly simple.
With just about 200 lines of code, you can create a fully playable retro game.
If you'd like to explore the code, or even play around with it, check out the script [here](./invader.py).
This script does not pretend to be production-ready invader game, just a fun toy example how to build a game with Textual.

# Game Plays

- You're the brave pilot of a spaceship ðŸ›¸, zipping left and right to ***fire*** your glorious shots.
- From above, swarms of invaders ðŸ‘¾ march down aiming to reach your last line of defense.
- Unlease your blazing shots to obliterate the invaders in bursts of glory.
- Victory is yours if you wipe them all out, but if even one invader slips through to the bottom, defeat will be your eternal companion.

# Lessons learned

Building terminal games with it isn't just possible but it's also a great way to explore the framework's capability for fun.
