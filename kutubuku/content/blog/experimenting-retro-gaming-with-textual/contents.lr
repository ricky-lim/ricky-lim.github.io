After building [TimerTui](https://github.com/ricky-lim/timertui), which taught me about widgets, layouts, and event handling in the terminal,
I wanted to experiment something fun.
That curiosity led me to create a simple retro game "Invader" with Textual.

This is what the gameplay looks like:

# Why Textual

Textual as a framework provides terminal hacks that make creating a retro game surprisingly simple.
With just about 200 lines of code, you can create a fully playable retro game.
If you'd like to explore the code, or even play around with it, check out the script [here](/invader.py).

# Game Plays

- You're the brave pilot of a spaceship ðŸ›¸, zipping left and right to fire your glorious shots.
- From above, swarms of invaders ðŸ‘¾ march down aiming to reach your last line of defense.
- Unlease your blazing shots to obliterate the invaders in bursts of glory.
- Victory is yours if you wipe them all out, but if even one invader slips through to the bottom, defeat will be your eternal companion.

# Lessons learned

Building terminal games with it isn't just possible but it's also a great way to explore the framework's flexibility while having fun.
