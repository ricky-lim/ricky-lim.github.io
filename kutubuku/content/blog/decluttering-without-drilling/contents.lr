Let's be honest, we all have that one shelf in our room that is a magnet for our clutter.
We want to tidy it up, but with limited space, the only solution seems to be hanging things and hanging things usually means drilling holes into the wall. Meh 😒!

The good news: you don't have to anymore.
You can mount a **pegboard** using **3M Claw hooks** instead.

Pegboards are practical for organizing and also keeping our items visible, while maximizing vertical space.
They're perfect for decluttering everything from our toys to our office gadgets.
But the conventional method to hang one has involved drilling... until now.

Thanks to **3M Claw hooks**, we can now hang a pegboard securely without any drilling.

Check out my setup with a pegboard mounted using 3M Claw hooks:

3\. Clip the 3M Claw Hooks on the chosen surface, ensuring they are level and spaced according to your pegboard size.

4\. Slide the pegboard over the hooks and voila!

## Key Takeaways

Embrace the power of pegboards and 3M Claw hooks to declutter your space without the hassle of drilling.
